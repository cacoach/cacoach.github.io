Recnently I broke my ubuntu and had to reinstall it ,So while searching the internet for some essential
software to install ,I found there is no usefull list for important must have software for a developer,
So the main focous of this blog will be how to set up Ubuntu for a developer.

Sublime-Text
------
 it’s undeniable that Linux is great for programmers, and if you’re going to be doing any kind of programming or scripting at all, then you should really consider installing Sublime Text. It’s the best text editor out there and almost as good as an IDE.
 How to install
 ```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/sublime-text-3

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install sublime-text-installer

```

Apache, Mysql and php
------
 The Apache web server is among the most popular web servers in the world. It's well-documented, and has been in wide use for much of the history of the web, which makes it a great default choice for hosting a website.
 How to install
 ```
sudo apt-get install apache2
 ```

Now that we have our web server up and running, it is time to install MySQL. MySQL is a database management system. Basically, it will organize and provide access to databases where our site can store information.
 How to install
 ```
 sudo apt-get install mysql-server
 ```
 Again, you will be shown a list of the packages that will be installed, along with the amount of disk space they'll take up. Enter "Y" to continue.

 PHP is the component of our setup that will process code to display dynamic content. It can run scripts, connect to our MySQL databases to get information, and hand the processed content over to our web server to display.
 How to install
 ```
 sudo apt-get install php libapache2-mod-php php-mcrypt php-mysql
 ```

 NodeJs

 Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. 
 How to install
 ```

 ```

 Vim

 Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.
