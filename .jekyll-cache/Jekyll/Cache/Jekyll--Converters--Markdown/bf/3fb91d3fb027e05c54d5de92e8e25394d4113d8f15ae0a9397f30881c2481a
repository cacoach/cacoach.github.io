I"º<p>A few days ago some of my juniors asked some question about linux and have to google all the details ,So then I thought
Why not write a blog that will help all those searching for the same thing and maybe (or hopefully) improve my writing 
Skills .</p>

<p>So mostly my blog will contain programming related stuff (Can post some philosphical stuff though)</p>

<p>So basically I will be writing a new blog per week and few blogs that I have in my mind right now are</p>

<p>1) Json vs ini</p>

<p>2) Getting started with Ubuntu</p>

<p>3) Making a server in NodeJS</p>

<p>If you have any doubt just commentâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>You can comment ,if you want me to write about a topic</strong></p>
