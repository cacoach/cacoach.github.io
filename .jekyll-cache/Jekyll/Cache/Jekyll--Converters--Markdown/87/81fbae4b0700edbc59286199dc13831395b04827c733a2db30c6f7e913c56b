I"É<p>So in this blog I will explain how to remove it, how does it works and why it is 
still not removed by facebook 
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="how-to-remove">How to remove</h2>
<p>So those of you who just came here to see how to remove it, it can be done in
following steps probably</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to chrome settings</li>
  <li>Click on Extensions in the sidebar</li>
  <li>Remove a extension called chromesecurity</li>
  <li>Also remove extensions that you donâ€™t remember installing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Congrats your virus have been removed
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>So it basically host an app on Heroku (Heroku is an app hosting site), So when a user
clicks on the link of the virus, it installs a extension on chrome and that extension 
chooses some of your fb friends.
It downloads their profile photo and name, and then creates a new app on heroku and than 
post that link on their wall.
And the loop continues
<br /><br /><br /></p>

<h2 id="why-it-is-still-not-removed-by-facebook">Why it is still not removed by facebook</h2>
<p>My guess is as it post videos on some of the friends timeline not all, so it remains undetected
due to low activity
<br /><br /><br /></p>
